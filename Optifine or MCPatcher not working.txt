Is your connected textures and or alternate textures not working?
Well, there is only one thing needing to be done. Turning alternate
texture on will only allow the default texture that are alternate,
alternate. MCPatcher will auto matically change it, so there should
be no prblem, but if there is. You may need to re-install MCPatcher
to select the right things to get it to work. Optifine how ever, you
can toggle it on/off ingame, by finding the Connected textures tab.
Turning this option to fast will make it work.
